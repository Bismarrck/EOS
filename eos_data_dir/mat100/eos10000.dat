! Basic properties
Key1 = 1.234D-3  # Density factor (Fortran D exponent)
key2 = 5.678e2   # Temperature factor

# Bulk modulus terms (example of multiple values for one key)
Key3 = 10.0 20.0 30.0 # These are three separate values associated with Key3

# Shear modulus terms (example with some comments)
Key4 = 100.0 # G0
       200.0 # G1, note: the current parser handles this as part of Key4 if on the same line after '='
             # but NOT if "200.0" is on a new line without "Key4 =" again.
             # The provided parser assumes all values for a key are on the same line as "key = ..."
             # To handle values for a key spanning multiple physical lines without repeating "key =",
             # the parser logic for key-value needs to be more stateful (e.g. track current key).
             # For now, to make it work with current parser:
             # Key4 = 100.0 200.0 300.0 # All on one line
             # OR if you have key4_param1, key4_param2 etc. in expected_param_order
